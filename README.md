This is a simple parsing yelp.com website using their api:

main.py - the whole finished program
Badtry.py - unsuccessful version of parsing with beautifulsoup4 + requests  but decided to leave it so that they could see that if you sit over it a little longer, then it will be finished
DataBaseWork.py - the file where I tested the work of the database
